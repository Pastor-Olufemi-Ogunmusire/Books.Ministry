        <p class="text">Parenting is one aspect of life that the church cannot but address. The kingdom of God suffers 
            reproach daily as result of parental carelessness. Promiscuity is now the order of the day. I see  
            this manual as i am permitted to call this book, as a guide in counseling rights on issues that many houses a re 
            struggling with. Also as map or compass that teenagers and youths can apply in making the future worthwhile. 
            The author has dealt with issues prevailing in our society in an educative manner to counsel and bring man to the path of God.
