        <p class="text">We live in a generaation where loyalty is currently in a short supply,
            almost everybody run on a fast lane. Patience s no longer a virtue- this is responsible for the 
            half-baked skilled workers and professionals in workplaces and part of the problem in the christendom. 
            Many supposed followers abandon their leaders due to temporary issues, so many wives abandon their 
            husbands because of temporary haerdships. <br>
            We have seen apprentices absconding before completion of their skills acquisition. once they've
            partially known the job. No wonder when you give your car to some auto-mechanical to fix they end up 
            damaging your vehincle. There is no shortcut to success- you can't break the loyalty circle and standout. <br>
            Loyalty and reward go hand in hand; if your loyalty is not complete, reward may be denied, tarry or frustrated.
