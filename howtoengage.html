        <p class="text">In the Bible, God used strange weapons to fight wars.
            Notable among such weapons is the grat flood in the days of Noah.
            The Devil watches God closely and most times imitate him and perverts
            His Method to fight mankind. <br> <br> As Children of God.
            we are expected to be wiser. if these weapons were engaged by
            God to produce results, then they can equally work for us.
            but until one understands how to operate a weapon he may not
            be able to engaged it in wars. That's the reason for this book.
            You hold in your hands, an expository 'eye opner' on how you can use
            the weapon of the wind to defeat your adversaries and also activate
            great changes in your life.
